# Samples
In this directory are some sample programs to show what Jafi can do. To execute these samples change directory to the sample then execute the python file. The jafi code that is being used can be found in each sample directory as well.

haskell_hw_* are translations of haskell assignments from CS403 to Jafi. Quicksort is also a translation from a Haskell algorithm.
